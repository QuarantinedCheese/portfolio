        <p>Hello! I am Ethan Pothier, currently a Humber Polytechnic student, in my first year of the Computer Programming and Analysis program.</p>

        <p>I'd like to be able to take my interest in computer software into my career in the future, whether it be backend or frontend, I'm just looking around for now! I've been apart of a few coding competetions through the years, though I'll admit, the latter competetions I did, I failed pretty badly. The second time though, my teacher had forgotten to teach something that we would need for the contest, so I blame him entirely. And also me for not doing my own research just in case...</p>

        <p>Should I change my mind or this doesn't work out, I'd love to try and make writing a career, too! I've been practicing in any freetime I can gather, and I enjoy it a lot. It's fun to take random stories that pop into my head and make them understandable to a stranger. So far I haven't finished anything too long, only about 4-5k words, but with time I'm sure I'll become comfortable writing longer!</p>

        <p>Other than what I've already mentioned, here's what else i'm interested biking and playing video games! The whole 'touch grass' meme is kind of funny to me, especially when I've just gotten back from a ride and I hop on a game to wind down from the excitement, only to be told to 'touch grass' simply because I've played the game over a long time and thus have had more time to get good. The main games I've been playhing recently are: Brick Rigs, Rimworld, and Deep Rock Galactic.</p>

        <p>Brick rigs allows me to build pretty much whatever I want, but it's an indie game primarily focused on the creation of vehicles! Originally it had a lego-like style, with bricks just like the lego ones, but over time it's evolved into it's own thing. I love how with enough skill you can accomplish pretty much whatever you want. As long as you're willing to put in the time and effort in teaching yourself a new technique, you can build anything you haven't before! Rimworld, I just enjoy a lot. It's a 2D city builder essentially, where you found the colony with an ultimate goal in mind. You don't have to complete that goal though; if you'd like you can just build the colony of your dreams! That's mostly what I do in it. Deep Rock Galactic is a game I've been playing as a main way to play with friends, it's just a lot of fun! To quickly summarise, you are a dwarf working in a mining company, and you dive deep underground with objectives you have to complete, but you have to be careful of the dangerous giant bugs down there!</p>

        <p>Anyway, I feel like this ended up becoming more about the games than it does me, but I felt it would be helpful to use my current favourite games as a way to explain myself a little more. Maybe once I've got more accomplishments to mention, this will become less about games, and more about me!</p>
