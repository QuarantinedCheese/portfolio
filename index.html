<!-- ABOUT -->
    <div class="section">
        <h3>About me:</h1>

        <p>Hello! I am Ethan Pothier, currently a Humber Polytechnic student, in my first year of the Computer Programming and Analysis program. I graduated from Sydenham Highschool, after focusing on computer tech classes and advanced math.</p>

        <p>I'd like to take my interest in computer software into my career in the future, preferably backend. At least when it comes to websites, I do not like doing frontend. I've been apart of a few coding competetions through the years but I've never placed anywhere too impressive.</p>

        <p>Should I change my mind or this doesn't work out, I'd love to try and make writing a career, too! I've been practicing in any freetime I can gather, and I enjoy it a lot. It's fun to take random stories that pop into my head and put them into words. So far I haven't finished anything too long, only about 4-5k words, but I'm still practicing!</p>

        <p>Other than what I've already mentioned, i'm interested biking and playing video games! The 'touch grass' meme is kind of funny to me, especially when I've just gotten back from a ride and I hop on a game to wind down, only to be told to 'touch grass' simply because I've played the game over a few years. The main games I've been playing recently are: Brick Rigs, Rimworld, and Deep Rock Galactic.</p>

        <p>Brick rigs allows me to build almost whatever I want, but it's an indie game focused on the creation of vehicles! Originally it had a lego-like style, with lego-like bricks, but over time it's evolved to be separate. As long as you're willing to put in the time and effort in teaching yourself a new technique, you can build anything you haven't before! Rimworld, I just enjoy a lot. It's a 2D city builder essentially, where you found a colony with an ultimate goal in mind. You don't have to complete that goal though; if you'd like you can just build the colony of your dreams! That's mostly what I do in it. Deep Rock Galactic is a game I've been playing as a main way to play with friends, it's just a lot of fun! To quickly summarise, you are a dwarf working in a mining company, and you dive deep underground to complete objectives, but beware of giant bugs!</p>

        <p>Anyway, I feel like this ended up becoming more about the games than it does me, but I felt it would be helpful to use my current favourite games as a way to explain myself a little more. Maybe once I've got more accomplishments to mention, this will become less about games, and more about me!</p>
