<!-- ABOUT -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>About me!</h2>

        <p>Hello! I am Cheese, currently an online Humber Polytechnic student, in my first year of the Computer Programming and Analysis program. I graduated from highschool, focusing on computer tech classes and advanced math. I have chosen to make this portfolio anonymous for now, because I highly value my online privacy.</p>

        <p>I'd like to take my interest in computer software into my career in the future, preferably backend. At least when it comes to websites, I do not like doing frontend. I've been apart of a few coding competetions through the years but I've never placed anywhere too impressive.</p>

        <p>Should I change my mind or this doesn't work out, I'd love to try and make writing a career, too! I've been practicing in any freetime I can gather, and I enjoy it a lot. It's fun to take random stories that pop into my head and put them into words. So far I haven't finished anything too long, but I'm still practicing!</p>

        <p>I tend to use anthropomorphic characters in my writing because I find them more interesting and expressive, and it makes it easier to tell characters apart by sight description alone. I am not great on my knowledge of clothes, so this also makes it so that I can distract from that fact.</p>

        <p>In highschool, I collaborated with Queens University to make a game that uses one of their motion-capturing systems! It is an endless runner, similar to the chrome dinosaur game, where you play a rogue robot stuck on mars, trying to escape!</p>

        <p>Other than that, i'm interested biking and playing video games! The 'touch grass' meme is kind of funny to me, especially when I've just gotten back from a ride and I hop on a game to wind down, only to be told to 'touch grass' because I happen to be good. The main games I've been playing recently are: Brick Rigs, Rimworld, and Deep Rock Galactic.</p>
